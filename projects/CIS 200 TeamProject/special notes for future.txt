Special Notes:


If I solve an equation involving:

*Processing Time/Idle Time ----> (PT/IT)
*ClockTime/Jobs Completed ---->(CT/JC)
*AVG Arrival time
*AVG arrival time for each job
*AVG processing time 
*AVG processing time for each job
*Total clock time (CT) 
*PT == total processing time
--> so far I am thinking of having this equation:

	(PT/IT)*(CT/JC)

**see picture from phone for whiteboard image of the line of thinking I had when I thouhgt of this

//if i can solve this equation, then it can be used to solve the ideal number of processors 
//based on the average process times and avg arrival times of any job data file
//in doing this, (finding the ideal # of processors) then we can select the most feasible CPU size that is closest to the ideal amount
